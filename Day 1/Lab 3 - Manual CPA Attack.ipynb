    "Last time, we didn't go into much detail on capturing traces. This time, we'll take a closer look at the firmware. It uses something called simpleserial for communication, which is a simple communication protocol that we use for most of our firmware. We can use it to send different commands to the target and also to receive data. `simpleserial-aes` has two commands we care about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'k'` - Set the key used for the AES implementation\n",
    "* `'p'` - Send a plaintext to the target for it to encrypt. When the encryption is finished, it will respond with an `'r'` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `target.simpleserial_write(<cmd>, <data>)` and `target.simpleserial.read(<cmd>, <dlen>)` to send and receive data. Basically, we want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the AES key used on the target using the `'k'` command\n",
    "1. Arm the scope (`scope.arm()`)\n",
    "1. Send the plaintext \n",
    "1. Capture the trace (`scope.capture()`). Note that this doesn't return the trace that gets captured, it returns whether (1) or not (0) the capture timed out\n",
    "1. Read the ciphertext back\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get the trace you just captured with `scope.get_last_trace()`. You'll want to do steps 2 through 5 multiple times.\n",
