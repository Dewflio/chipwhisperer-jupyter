We can use it to send different commands to the target and also to receive data. `simpleserial-aes` has two commands we care about:\n",

While the mathematics behind the security of AES are pretty complicated, the operations within it are actually pretty simple. Even better, for this attack, we only care about the first two operations: `add_round_key()` and `sub_bytes()`. `add_round_key()` is super simple; it's just an XOR (`^` operation) between the AES state (which at the beginning is just the plaintext) and the key. As we discussed earlier, the linearity of this operation makes it difficult to attack, so let's move onto the next operation, `sub_bytes()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sub_bytes()`, which is an 8-bit lookup, is basically perfect for us to attack! It's designed to be very non-linear to defend against other types of attacks, and it being an 8-bit operation means that we can break the key down into 16 8-bit chunks and attack each individually!
